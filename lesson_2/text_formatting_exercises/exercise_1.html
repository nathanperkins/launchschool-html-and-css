    <p>In the example below, the table consists of two individual columns and one column group spanning three columns. It has six rows. There are two headers that span multiple rows. To make sure that such header cells that span multiple rows are correctly associated with all the cells in those rows, the rows need to be grouped. To define row groups wrap the corresponding rows in tbody elements (table body). Additionally the scope attribute of header cells spanning rows has to be set to rowgroup.</p>
